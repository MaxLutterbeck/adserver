FlashObject v.1.0
====================
This FlashObject Helper is based on the flash view helper of the plugin http://laszlo-plugin.rubyforge.org/

It's only copy the FlashObject.js (version 1.5) on your public/javascript directory and register it in the AssetTagHelper of rails,
so for include the javascript in your page you only can add this (if you havn't yet):

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

or if you only need the flashobject add this:

<%= javascript_include_tag "flashobject" %>

The is very simple for add a Flash in your page add this:

<%= flashobject_tag "/source/of/your/flash.swf" %>

It's simple.

You can add some options if you want:

- div_id: the HTML +id+ of the +div+ element that is used to contain the Flash object; default "flashcontent"
- flash_id: the +id+ of the Flash object itself.
- background_color: the background color of the Flash object; default white
- flash_version: the version of the Flash player that is required; default "7"
- size: the size of the Flash object, in the form "100x100".  Defaults to "100%x100%"
- variables: a Hash of initialization variables that are passed to the object; default <tt>{:lzproxied => false}</tt>
- parameters: a Hash of parameters that configure the display of the object; default <tt>{:scale => 'noscale'}</tt>
- fallback_html: HTML text that is displayed when the Flash player is not available.

Example:
<%= flashobject_tag "/source/of/your/flash.swf", :size => "350x320" %>
